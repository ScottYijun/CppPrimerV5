While deleting the derived data eventually worked for me, it didn't help until I rebooted the iPad and OS/X, emptied the trash after using the Finder to delete the derived data, and removed a BLE peripheral connected via a USB port. I don't know which of the steps was required--XCode later compiled with the BLE peripheral attached--but once all of those steps were added to deleting the derived data, the project compiled fine
